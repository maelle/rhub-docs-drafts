# How to reproduce a bug uncovered by R-hub?

You could in theory experiment with your package, tinker with the code, submit it to R-hub again until the bug disappears but this would have a high turnaroud so is not optimal for debugging.

You can debug locally for Linux platforms, with R-hub Docker containers, no matter your operating system, granted you were able to install Docker itself.

For other platforms that you do not have access to locally, you might need to ask for help LINK TO ASK FOR HELP.
